## Setup Overview

You will need the following development software to get the demo app running from source. Any actions documented regarding macOS can be taken on a remote Mac as well.

>It is strongly recommended to install all software in the given order so Visual Studio Code can find the required Frameworks and SDKs right away.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Microsoft OpenJDK 17.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/install)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    - Android 14.0 ("UpsideDownCake") API Level 34
    - Android SDK Build-Tools 34
    - Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - [C# Dev Kit Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)
    - [.NET MAUI Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-maui)

You might be successful with other IDEs like Rider, but Microsoft recommends Visual Studio Code for .NET MAUI development so this documentation will not consider any other IDEs.

Don't forget to add your Apple Developer Account to XCode and to set up your Certificate and Profile (more detail below).

## Visual Studio Code Setup

1. Install the above mentioned extensions for Visual Studio Code
2. Clone the [emrtd-connector-sdk-maui](https://github.com/OVD-Kinegram-AG/emrtd-connector-sdk-maui)
3. Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code
4. Ignore the NuGet error popping up fow now, the NuGet will be built later on
5. Confirm installation of the `.NET MAUI SDK` if asked
6. Install missing components and SDKs (if there are any left at this point):
   ```
   cd kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui
   dotnet workload restore
   ```
  
7. Again, in your terminal, trigger a build on the missing NuGet:
   ```
   cd kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui-android
   dotnet build kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui-android.csproj
   ```

This will create the `kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui-android.x.x.x.nupkg` which is the `Android eMRTD Connector SDK` wrapped in a NuGet for use in .NET MAUI. You can find further information regarding the SDKs and the steps required to apply changes made by yourself in the respective section below.

### Starting the Android app

1. Open a code file in the editor, for example `Pages/MainPage.xaml.cs`
2. Click the curly brackets in the Status Bar (bottom right), click `Debug Target` and pick your device from the list presented
3. If Visual Studio Code asks for an Android SDK location, pick the one suggested, this usually is `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk` on macOS and `/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/Android/sdk` on Windows
4. Run the app
    - Click the `Run and Debug` icon on the left and then the `Run and Debug` button
    - Or click the `Run project associated with this file` (play icon) on the top right

### Starting the iOS app

1. Open `kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui.csproj`and adjust the values in `CodesignKey` and `CodesignProvision` for Debug and/or Release to your own certificate and profile names
2. Open `Platforms/Info.plist` and adjust `CFBundleIdentifier` to the bundle identifier you set in your Apple Developer Account for this app
3. Open a code file in the editor, for example `Pages/MainPage.xaml.cs`
4. Run the app
    - Click the `Run and Debug`icon on the left and then the `Run and Debug` button
    - Or click the `Run project associated with this file` (play icon) on the top right

## Customizing the eMRTD Android Connector SDK

1. Clone [emrtd-connector-sdk-android](https://github.com/OVD-Kinegram-AG/emrtd-connector-sdk-android.git)
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Apply your changes to the SDK library
4. Copy `emrtd-connector-sdk-android/kinegram-emrtd-connector/build/outputs/aar` to `kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui/kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui-android/libs` and recompile the MAUI app.

## Customizing changes to the eMRTD iOS Connector SDK

1. Clone [emrtd-connector-sdk-ios](https://github.com/OVD-Kinegram-AG/emrtd-connector-sdk-ios)
2. Open the project in XCode
3. Apply your changes to the SDK library
4. Copy `emrtd-connector-sdk-ios/ObjCFramework/Distribution/KinegramEmrtdConnectorObjC.xcframework` to `kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui/kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui-ios/Native`
5. Make sure you adjust `ApiDefinitions.cs` and `StructsAndEnums.cs` in `kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui/kinegram-emrtd-connector-maui-ios` if you made modifications to the respective calls
